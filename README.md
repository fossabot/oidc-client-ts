# oidc-client-ts

[![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/oidc-client-ts.svg)](https://npm.im/oidc-client-ts)
![Pipeline](https://github.com/authts/oidc-client-ts/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

Library to provide OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth2 protocol support for client-side, browser-based JavaScript client
applications. Also included is support for user session and access token management.

This is a forked version of the [oidc-client-js](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js) library, which has
been archived and is no longer maintained. This version has been refactored from JavaScript to TypeScript. Trying to keep the API as compatible as possible. The support for the outdated implicit flow has been removed.

**Contributions and help is much appreciated!**
